This repository contains scripts and code used in a study of latitudinal and elevational migration, blood physiology, morphology, and genomics of giant hummingbirds (*Patagona spp.*) in South America. In our paper, we report the world's longest hummingbird migration with the most extreme elevational shift, and describe the world's largest hummingbird species, a distinct species that was previously undescribed. Field sampling spanned Chile to Peru and involved collaborative teams from the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico, Centro de Ornitología y Biodiversidad (CORBIDI), and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. 

Code and scripts are roughly arranged in sub-folders by topic. Workflow outlined below is roughly in the order of pipelines and analyses. If you use something here, please cite us (Williamson et al. 2024, PNAS; and repository DOI), or contact Jessie about who/what is best to cite.
